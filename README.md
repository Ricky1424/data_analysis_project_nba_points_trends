# data_analysis_project_nba_points_trends
 In this data science project, I analyse NBA data from the seasons of 2010 and 2014. By exploring various relationships between quantitative and categorical variables, I aim to uncover insights into team performance, game outcomes, and predictive analytics.

# NBA Trends Project: Key Findings

## Overview
This project analyzed NBA data from 2010 and 2014 to uncover insights into team performance, game outcomes, and predictive analytics based on 538's data.

## Key Findings

### 1. Points Scored Comparison
- In 2010, the Knicks scored more points than the Nets with a mean difference of 9.7 points per game.
- In 2014, there was a shift in the mean difference between the Knicks and Nets' scores, reducing to 0.4 points per game.

### 2. Team Performance Analysis (2010)
- Boxplots showed varying distributions of points scored per game by different franchises, indicating differences in performance.

### 3. Home vs. Away Game Performance
- Contingency tables revealed differences in win/loss ratios between home and away games, suggesting potential performance disparities.

### 4. Relationship Between Predicted Win Probability and Margin of Victory
- Covariance analysis showed an association between 538's forecasted win probability and the point differential.
- Pearson correlation coefficient indicated a moderate positive correlation between forecasted win probability and point differential.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into NBA trends, including team performance dynamics, game outcome patterns, and the relationship between predictive analytics and actual game results. Further analysis could inform strategic decisions within the basketball industry.
